## Interface: 50400
## Title: RarityRadar
## Notes: Tired of manually looting everything? RarityRadar automatically grabs valuable items based on rarity, handles crafting materials from disenchanting/professions, and manages group loot rolling. Set your minimum quality threshold and let it work in the background while you focus on playing.
